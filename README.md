# Students Mental Health

In this modest case study, I used PostgreSQL to delve into a dataset from a Japanese international university, focusing on the mental health impacts on its students. This analysis explored the challenges of acculturative stress and social connectedness, particularly looking at how the length of stay affects international students' well-being. This project offered valuable insights into the nuanced experiences of studying abroad.
